# Vision-Based-Attendance-System

The computer vision-based attendance system with facial recognition technology aims to simplify and enhance the accuracy of attendance tracking. This system uses a person's facial features to identify and verify them, eliminating the need for manual attendance tracking. It can be used for various groups of people, including employees and students.

The facial recognition attendance system also eliminates the need for manual entry and exit time monitoring, as it automates the process. In light of the Covid-19 pandemic, it reduces physical contact in public places and work environments, making it a safer option.

Facial recognition technology is widely utilized for attendance tracking, with companies such as True in using mobile devices for time and attendance tracking. This makes it a convenient and effective solution for tracking employee hours, keeping up with modern-day technological advancements.
